**Caching Data in Android using Shared Preferences**
Shared Preferences can be used to cache data and save it on local storage. Caching is important when dealing with API calls as this reduces the redundancy in API hits. I have implemented the code for using shared preferences to cache API response and use that response for future and thus reducing unnecessary API calls.
